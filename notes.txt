Get Excel Sheet Viewer on VS Code


Install Pandas


I'd recommend:

Use Excel if:

One-time cleaning task
Small dataset
Simple operations
Non-technical team
Need immediate visual feedback


Use Python if:

Repeated cleaning tasks
Large datasets
Complex operations
Need reproducibility
Part of larger automation
Multiple people need to use same process
