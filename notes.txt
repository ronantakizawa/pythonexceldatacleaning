Get Excel Sheet Viewer on VS Code
Install Pandas

For rows:

Use .loc[] for label-based indexing: df.loc[5] gets row with index 5
Use .iloc[] for position-based indexing: df.iloc[5] gets the 6th row
Boolean indexing: df[df['Age'] > 21] gets rows where Age > 21
Row slicing: df[3:7] gets rows with indices 3, 4, 5, 6

For columns:

Direct column access: df['Name'] gets the Name column
Multiple columns: df[['Name', 'Age']] gets both columns
Through .loc[]: df.loc[:, 'Name'] gets the Name column (all rows)
Through .iloc[]: df.iloc[:, 2] gets the 3rd column










I'd recommend:
Use Excel if:

One-time cleaning task
Small dataset
Simple operations
Non-technical team
Need immediate visual feedback

Use Python if:

Repeated cleaning tasks
Large datasets
Complex operations
Need reproducibility
Part of larger automation
Multiple people need to use same process
